These connected systems allow people to share (or “serve”) information to others. The internet can be visualized as a web, with multiple routes and connections. If one connection is severed, the redundancy of the web infrastructure allows people to connect by finding another route. To get from one location to another, web traffic (messages sent on the internet) make many hops. Traffic travels from router to router before arriving at their destination. In order to do this, specific networking and routing equipment is required. This is provided by Internet Service Providers (“ISPs”). ISPs allow internet users to use their infrastructure, including \"serving\" content or providing access to other content that other ISPs \"serve\", usually for a fee.",
